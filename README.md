# C Primer Plus Exercises
This repository contains some of the C programming exercises from the book, "C Primer Plus" - Stephen Prata

Some of the exercises contain the recommended answers (typically the even-numbered exercises); however, I will 
generally post my final version instead of a copy-and-paste version of what comes with the book. I think that
this will benefit me in the future when I go back to reference and see how much I've learned, but also provide
possible, different solutions to the same problem.

The rest, however, are not listed in any reference list or answer sheet that I have been able to find. These
are my best attempts at performing the tasks required, and I'll often go back to them to make relevant changes
and updates as I progress.

Feedback and opinions are always welcome. Hope this helps others who are learning using the same book or just
learning C in general.

Thanks for stopping by!
