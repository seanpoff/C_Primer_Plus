# C Primer Plus Exercises
This repository contains some of the C programming exercises from the book, "C Primer Plus" - Stephen Prata

Some of the exercises contain the recommended answers (typically the even numbered exercises); however, there are 
instances where I may have done things differently. In most cases, I try to incorporate as much "protection" to 
my code as possible using what I've learned from the book so far.

The odd numbered exercises, however, are not listed in any reference list or answer sheet that I have been able to 
find. These are my best attempts at performing the tasks required, and I'll often go back to them to make 
relevant changes and updates as I progress.

In addition to what I've been learning while reading this book, I will also be incorporating practices and 
formatting recommendations that I've found online from Carnegie Mellon University's Electrical and Computer 
Engineering student resources section.

I openly welcome feedback and suggestions as I'm in no position to teach or say that my way is the right way. On 
the contrary, I'm currently in a learning environment and will continue to learn as much as I can. 

Thanks for stopping by!
